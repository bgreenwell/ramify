#' ramify: additional matrix functionality
#' 
#' Additional matrix functionality for R including: (1) wrappers
#' for the base matrix function that allows matrices to be created from character 
#' strings and lists (the former is especially useful for creating block 
#' matrices), (ii) better printing of large matrices via a new generic function
#' for "pretty" printing, and (iii) a number of convenience functions for users 
#' more familiar with other scientific languages like 'Julia', 'Matlab'/'Octave', 
#' or 'Python'+'NumPy'.
