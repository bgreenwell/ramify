Description: Additional matrix functionality for R including: (1) wrappers
    for the base matrix function that allows matrices to be created from character
    strings and lists (the former is especially useful for creating block
    matrices), (ii) better printing of large matrices via a new generic function for
    "pretty" printing, and (iii) a number of convenience functions for users more
    familiar with other scientific languages like 'Julia', 'Matlab'/'Octave', or
    'Python'+'NumPy'.
