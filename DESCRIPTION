Description: Additional matrix functionality for R. Includes a wrapper for the 
  base matrix function that allows matrices to be created more easily from 
  character strings and lists. A number of convenience functions have also been 
  included for users more familiar with other scientific languages like Julia, 
  MATLAB/Octave, or Python.
